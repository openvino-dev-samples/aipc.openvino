**Product Brief**
Intel® Xeon® 6 processors with Efficient-cores

Network and Edge scalability meets efficient-core density. With higher performanceper-watt1 and up to 144 cores per socket, Intel® Xeon® 6 processors with E-cores offer greater parallel processing for workload throughput, while maximizing value.

- Drive high throughput and power efficiency while improving sustainability for network and edge workloads

Utilize highly task-parallel, efficient compute on cores that drive performance for networking and edge workloads in today’s thriving markets. Intel® Xeon® 6 processors with Efficient-cores (E-cores) enable higher performance-per-watt compared to the 2nd Gen Intel® Xeon® processor1, featuring up to 144 cores per socket available on 6700 series, and higher on 6900 series platform2. Integrated accelerators3 provide targeted enhancements for network and security workloads, amplifying overall efficiency and productivity. Intel® Xeon® 6 processors with E-cores spell great news, whether you are a software engineer looking to boost your edge solutions and products, or a network architect redesigning your services.

- Up to 144 cores per socket enable high density, efficiency, and throughput

Enhance parallel processing with up to 144 cores per socket in 1- or 2-socket platforms to drive faster results, process more packets with encryption, and support more microservices across distributed environments. Built-in acceleration3 speeds up encryption and compression, enhances resource management across cores, and accelerates edge and network workloads. Efficient TDP ranges of 205W–330W drive higher performance-per-watt1, which enables compute resources at the edge to be used more efficiently than upstream cloud processing to contribute to sustainability efforts across businesses.

- Support the next-gen security capabilities your growth depends on

Ramp up security operations for 5G networks and edge-to-cloud infrastructure to support advanced capabilities such as deep packet inspection, granular policy control, zero trust network, and next-gen firewalls (NGFWs). Confidential computing technologies such as Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX) and Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) help secure in-flight applications and data in trusted execution environment, mitigating the larger attack surface of service-based architectures, and helping to shield encryption key operations from exploits.

- Capitalize on investments with common architectures, simplified designs, and longer deployments

Deploy platforms that are tuned and optimized for networking, edge, and security workloads, with greater longevity2 to help businesses derive more value from their investments. Intel® Ethernet, GPU, IPU, world-class support, and an ecosystem of optimized software and tools help ensure success for networking and edge deployments. PCH-less boot and platform compatibility with P-core processors provide more design flexibility for solution designers while extending the value of validation cycles to more offerings.
